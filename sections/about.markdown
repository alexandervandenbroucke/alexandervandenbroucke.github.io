Hello, I'm Alexander Vandenbroucke. I'm a Ph.D. student in the
[Programming Languages Group](http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~tom.schrijvers/research.html)
of Professor [Tom Schrijvers](http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~tom.schrijvers/) at
the KU Leuven (University of Leuven).

Programming languages have fascinated me since I was first introduced to the
functional programming language Haskell during the second year of my
Bachelor's degree.
Three years later, working on my Master Thesis, I
discovered that that the design, the implementation and use of (functional)
programming languages is a vibrant and interesting subdiscipline of computer
science that I wanted to explore further.
