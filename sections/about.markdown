### <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Interests
Programming languages have fascinated me since I was first introduced to the
functional programming language Haskell during the second year of my
Bachelor's degree.
Three years later, working on my Master Thesis, that the design, implementation
and use of programming languages is a vibrant and interesting subdiscipline
of computer science that I wanted to explore further.
